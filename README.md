# FlexBox (Coursework Project)

This project was coursework for my Advanced Programming Concepts unit.

## About This Project
Please read the 'spec.pdf' file in this directory for information on this coursework.

A database was **not** allowed for this project, and so configuration files were used to encapsulate domain information and constraints.

Antlr was used to parse the external DSL file (src/com/thomaspunt/flexbox/config/BoxTypes.dsl) that stores the business logic for the valid box types.
