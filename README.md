# FlexBox (Coursework Project)

This project was coursework for my Advanced Programming Concepts unit.

## About This Project
Please read the 'spec.pdf' file in this directory for information on this coursework.

A database was **not** allowed for this project, and so configuration files were used to encapsulate domain information and constraints.

Antlr was used to parse the external DSL file (src/com/thomaspunt/flexbox/config/BoxTypes.dsl) that stored valid box types business logic.

## Run This Project
In order to run this project, you will need to:
 - Clone this repo
 - Open the cloned repo using NetBeans (I've only tested this in NetBeans 8.0.1)
 - Download the Antrl 4.4 runtime .jar library (http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-runtime-4.4.jar)
 - Add the Antlr 4.4 runtime library to the NetBeans project (under the "Libraries" folder)
